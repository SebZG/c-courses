/* 
    Data Structures are ways to store and
    organize data in a computer so that ican be accessed
    and modified efficiently.
    They are essential for solving complex computational
    problems, enabling optimized algorithms, and
    improving performance in various
    applications like databases, operating
    systems, and compilers. Proper use of data
    structures is crucial for building scalable and
    efficient software systems.

/* 
    - Data structures define the layout and
    relationships of data in memory.
    - They are classified into tow main types:
    linear (arrays, linked lists) and non-linear (trees, graphs).
    - Efficient data structures allow faster data manipulation,
    leading to better program performance.
    - Common operations include insertion, deletion,
    traversal, and searching.
    - Understanding the right choice of data structure
    is fundamental for solving algorithmic problems effectively.
    - Some examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, 
    hash tables, trees, and graphs.
