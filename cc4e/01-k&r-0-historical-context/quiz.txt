Before Brian Kernighan wrote the "C Programming Book", what was he writing?

 Billing programs in COBOL

 Web servers to support geo-location

 A series of tutorial documents on topics like B and C

What was the main shortcoming of the "B" language? (a precursor to C)

 It was not good at handling bytes (8-bit characters)

 It did not support the FORTRAN FORMAT statement

 It did not have first class functions

 It did not use indentation as syntax

When was the C language "under construction" as it was co-evolving with the creation of UNIX?

 1985

 1975

 1965

 1980

What was a key goal in the design of the C language?

 Implement all the core structures of Python (list, dict, tuple)

 The need to precisely describe the headers in the TSP/IO protocols

 Replicating the FORTRAN PRINT and computer GOTO language elements

 Reduce the need to write assembly language in UNIX

 IETF

 ISO

 ANSI

 Posix

 Minix

 Lunix

 MIT

 Harvard

 Stanford Univerity

 University of Berkeley

What went wrong in the late 1980's that took UNIX out of the running to be the universal operating system? This action led to the creation of a series of UNIX-like operating systems that now dominate the market.

 C Pointers were just too complex for the average programmer to understand.

 UNIX's lack of support for FORTRAN was a major barrier to adoption

 UNIX was never able to fully support the emerging TCP/IP stack needed for ARPANET, NSFNet, and the modern Internet

 The owners of UNIX tried to make money with it by using restrictive licensing

What company created UNIX and C?

 AT&T

 Microsoft

 IBM

 Sun Microsystems
